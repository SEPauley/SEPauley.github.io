     <p> I teach high school English in Trenton, Missouri. I have been teaching for six years. In that time, 
        I have worked in several districts teaching multiple grade levels. I am certified to teach 5-12 
        English and K-12 Library. I earned a bachelor’s degree in creative writing from Truman State 
        University. While there, I also minored in political science and interned at the Missouri Capitol. 
        After working as a paraprofessional for a year, I returned to Truman to earn a master’s degree in 
        English education. As a teacher, I am always seeking to further my education. I participated in 
        the Prairie Lands Writing Project (a National Writing Project site) in 2019. I am currently a 
        graduate student at the University of Missouri, working toward a master’s degree in library and 
        information science with an emphasis in e-learning. My anticipated graduation date is December 
        2022.
