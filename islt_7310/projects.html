    <h2>Projects</h2>


   <h2 id="THS">Trenton High School</h2> 
   <h4>High School English Teacher, August 2021-present</h4>

<div class="Trenton">
    <p class="Reflection">In my current position, I teach five sections of 11th grade English language arts. In this course, students 
    read and analyze the standards of American literature (The Crucible, The Great Gatsby, the poetry of 
    Whitman and Hughes, the short stories of Hawthorne and Poe, seminal speeches and documents). I also 
    teach research skills, including using databases, paraphrasing and embedding quotes, and correctly citing 
    sources. <br>Throughout the 2021-2022 school year, the faculty at Trenton High School has been working on 
    aligning the curriculum with Missouri Learning Standards. I worked with the English department to 
    identify priority standards for 11th grade. I am currently writing success criteria for each priority 
    standard. As the sole LA III teacher at THS, I have great flexibility when it comes to curriculum. I have used this 
    flexibility to prioritize authentic, in-depth learning over covering the maximum amount of content. These experiences include the class blog discussed here.</p>

    <img class="Gatsby" src="gatsby.jpg" alt="Gatsby blog" width="300">

    <p class="Art-Ref"> One project that I am especially proud of is the Great Gatsby Class Blog. I adapted this project from a more 
    traditional culminating project where students create a newspaper at the end of a unit. In this project, 
    students write blog posts over events in the novel throughout the unit. This allows students to share their 
    analysis beyond the confines of the classroom. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="MHS">Moberly High School</h2>
    <h4>High School English, August 2020-May 2021</h4>

<div class="Moberly">

    <p class="Reflection">At Moberly High School, I taught four sections of freshman LA I and three sections of junior LA III. In 
        this position, I worked closely with the other English faculty members to plan units. Due to the Covid-19 
        pandemic, the school offered online sections of each course during the 2020-2021 school year. I taught 
        one online section of LA I and one online section of LA III. I utilized many technologies to deliver 
        content to my online students. I used Edpuzzles to present content, screencasts to explain assignments, 
        and Google Meet to communicate face-to-face. These digital lessons and tools were also handy for 
        keeping in-person students on track during the frequent quarantines that took place during the year. 
        <br>Moberly is the largest district at which I have taught. This had positive and challenging aspects. One 
        positive aspect was that I worked with a more racially diverse population than I have taught in other 
        schools. This meant that students brought more diverse backgrounds and opinions to the table when 
        reading texts like To Kill a Mockingbird. The main challenge in this position was the lack of flexibility in 
        planning the curriculum. Because multiple teachers taught the same course, we were expected to be on the 
        same page. </p>

    <img class="Bitmoji" src="bitmoji.jpg" alt="Bitmoji Classroom Video" width="300">


    <p class="Art-Ref">This video was one of the best resources I created for my online students. I created a digital classroom on 
        Google Slides, then added a digital version of myself via Bitmoji. For each slide, I wrote content in a 
        textbox and put that on the whiteboard. I then recorded a lesson via Screencastify and uploaded the video 
        to Youtube. </p>

    <h2 id="Trico">Tri-County High School</h2>
    <h4>5th-8th Grade English, August 2017-May 2020</h4>

<div class="Jamesport">

    <p class="Reflection"> At Tri-County (Jamesport), I taught a variety of middle school English classes. The exact classes varied 
    each year. My first year, I taught 6th, 7th, and 8th grade English and a creative writing exploratory class. 
    The next year, I taught 5th, 6th, and 7th grade reading and writing. My final year, I taught 5th, 6th, and 
    7th grade English and a drama exploratory. I was instrumental in introducing Google Workspace for 
    Education at the middle school. Having Google accounts opened doors for students to create more content 
    using technology. In addition to my classroom responsibilities, I also directed the middle school play for 
    two years. During my final year in this position, the district began the process of revamping the 
    curriculum to better align with state standards. As part of this goal, I rewrote several novel units to 
    address specific literature standards. 
    <br> Jamesport Tri-County is a rural district where teachers have smaller classes and more preps than at larger 
    districts. Planning for multiple preps was a challenge. However, I started this position earlier in my 
    teaching career and enjoyed the opportunity to put into action the strategies I learned during college. At 
    first I tried to use a reading and writing workshop model. I later switched to whole class literature units, 
    such as The Outsiders for 7th graders. In all grade levels, I emphasized writing. Students wrote fiction, 
    research papers, and procedural writing. </p>

    <img class="Robot" src="robot.jpg" alt= "Robot Alien Clone student work" width="300">

    <p class="Art-Ref">The Robot Alien Clones project was a brief unit I created for 5th grade writing. It involved procedural 
        writing and compare/ contrast writing. First, I created “robot aliens” using Styrofoam cups, pipe cleaners, 
        stickers, and clothespins. Students each chose a robot alien and wrote a thorough description. The goal 
        was to write a good enough description that a classmate could recreate the original. After creating a clone, 
        students compared and contrasted the original robot alien with the clone.
