        <h3>Hi! My name is Sarah Pauley. I enjoy reading, writing, and sharing my love of language with 
            students.</h3>

        <p>The goal of this website is to demonstrate my creativity and competency as an educator to 
        potential employers. This site functions as a professional portfolio where I reflect on my 
        experiences, achievements, and future goals. The about page summarizes my educational 
        background and links to my resume. The experience page describes my most recent teaching 
        positions. On this page, I reflect on the skills and experience I gained in each position. I also 
        provide pictures and pdfs that demonstrate my achievements in that position. The philosophy 
        page outlines my teaching philosophy. I describe my belief in curiosity, creativity, and effort and 
        explain how my philosophy informs my current practice and future goals.
