    Hi! My name is Sarah Pauley. I teach high school English in Trenton, Missouri. I’m working toward a master’s in library science with an emphasis in e-learning. In my Introduction to Information Technology class a few semesters ago, I did individual stretch projects to build a website using HTML and CSS. I got a decent start, but didn’t actually produce a functional website. My expectations for this course are to learn web design skills in a logical order with assistance and feedback as needed – things that were missing from my attempts at independent learning. I want to be able to create or at least edit the format of websites for myself or volunteer organizations. My favorite hobby is probably music. I enjoy playing piano for myself and for church, and I also play clarinet in a small community orchestra.
