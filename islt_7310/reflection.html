    <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<div class="philosophy">

<h4>Creativity and Effort</h4>

<p class="philosophy-p1">The first week of 5th grade, my middle school gifted teacher shared her expectations for gifted 
class. The expectations were simple: our work should demonstrate creativity and effort. She went 
on to explain what she did and did not mean. I don’t recall her entire explanation, but the phrase 
“creativity and effort” has stuck with me for two decades now. This phrase is now the foundation 
of my own educational philosophy – although I add “curiosity” as a third expectation. Yes, I 
break down state standards and make sure students practice specific reading and writing skills. 
But I believe that true learning requires curiosity, creativity, and effort.</p>

<h4>Lighting a Fire</h4>

<p class="philosophy-p2">I agree with William Butler Yeats’ assertion that “education is not the filling of a pail, but the 
lighting of a fire.” Students bring their own experiences and prior knowledge to the classroom –
and this background knowledge adds valuable ideas to the conversation. This is especially true in 
an English language arts classroom. Basic understanding is necessary, but analysis, critical 
thinking, and creativity are the real goals. For example, the purpose of reading literature is to 
contemplate human nature, not to memorize facts. Writing is a vehicle for expressing original 
thoughts and adding to the conversation, not for regurgitating the “correct” answers. Analysis 
and critical thinking are more important than ever when it comes to reading informational texts. 
Students must evaluate the author’s purpose and the credibility of a source, rather than accepting 
all “facts” at face value. I encourage – in fact, I expect – divergent thinking in the classroom. I 
believe that this kind of thinking will best serve students as they navigate the world beyond high 
school.</p>

<h4>Project-Based Learning</h4>

<p class="philosophy-p2">When possible, I assess learning through projects or writing rather than multiple choice tests. 
These assessments allow students to demonstrate deep understanding through higher order 
thinking skills: analysis, creativity, evaluation. For example, this year I had students create board 
games as a culminating project for our short story unit. The goal of this project was to adapt an 
existing story to a new format. Students identified crucial events in the story that contributed to 
the plot, theme, mood or characterization. They also invented alternate choices that could have 
altered the plot or theme of the story. In a previous position, I taught much of the same content. 
Students read several of the same short stories and identified mood, theme, and similar literary 
elements. However, in my previous position, students were required to take a multiple choice test 
over the stories. While the multiple choice test covered all of the content presented in the unit, 
the board game project required students to truly understand the literary elements.</p>

<h4>Transformation through Technology</h4>

<p class="philosophy-p2">In addition to project-based learning, I am striving to incorporate more technology, digital 
literacy, and authentic assessment into my classes. One of the main challenges of teaching a 
required liberal arts course is the “why.” Students love to question why they are learning or 
doing something. While this questioning can be frustrating, it is also valid. Students need to 
create authentic content. They need opportunities to share this content with authentic audiences. 
This year I have started working to meet the need for authentic learning. During our poetry unit, 
I shared publishing opportunities and poetry contests and encouraged students to enter their 
work. My students are currently in the middle of a unit on <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. For this unit, I 
created a class blog where students post articles and reflections over the book. Instead of writing 
solely for the teacher, students are writing for their peers – and anyone else who might discover 
the blog online. In the future, I plan to do more along these lines. One of my plans is to have 
students create portfolio websites. They can use portfolios to highlight their best work 
throughout the year and reflect on their learning.</p>
